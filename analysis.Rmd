- indoor vs outdoor
- similar vs nonsimilar by year
- determine threshold
- make presentation
- think of another visual
- seperate by season
- conditions of mlr

## load dataset
```{r}

## Study similar vs non-similar country totals
```{r}
olympicsds %>%

         abs(elevdiff) > 300) %>%
  nrow()

olympicsds %>%
  filter(!is.na(abs(tempdiff)))
  mutate(similar = ifelse((abs(tempdiff) > 10) & (abs(elevdiff) > 300), 0, 1),
         similar = as.factor(similar)) %>%
  group_by(Year, Season, similar) 

%>%
  summarise(totmedratio = sum(medratio))

```



```{r}
summary(lm(medratio ~ tempdiff + elevdiff, data = olympicsds))
summary(lmer(medratio ~ tempdiff + elevdiff + Year + (1|region) + Season, data = olympicsds))

summary(lm(medratio ~ elevdiff, data = olympicsds))
