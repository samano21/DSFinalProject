## load dataset
```{r}

## Very Basic Graphs
```{r}
olympicsds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = elevdiff)) + geom_density()

olympicsds %>%
  filter(Season == "Winter", ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = elevdiff, y = medratio)) + geom_point()

olympicsds
```



```{r}
summary(lm(medratio ~ tempdiff + elevdiff, data = olympicsds))
summary(lmer(medratio ~ tempdiff + elevdiff + Year + (1|region) + Season, data = olympicsds))

summary(lm(medratio ~ elevdiff, data = olympicsds))
